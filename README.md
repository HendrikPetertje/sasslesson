# Sass!
This repository was made to teach a bit about the use of sass.

In rails folders and files prenamed with a _ will not be rendered by default... this is superhandy for partials for example.

Open up app/layouts/application.html.erb to get started with the html
Open up app/assets/stylesheets/application.sass to get started with the css
